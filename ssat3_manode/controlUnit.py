#  Version Notes: 0, initial build
#               
#   A module to manage all the classes and functions needed for the climate control
#   simulation. A typical heating and cooling unit would have noe or mroe independant 
#   sensors to check the area temperature and logic to determine if the current temperature
#   is within the desired range. When determined to be either too hot, or too cold the
#   appropriate cooling or heating function should be undertaken. 
#   
#   
#    During both heating an cooling cycles the temperature should also be monitored to identify
#    when the heating or cooling action should be returned to the "off state". Once the desired 
#    temperature has been achieved it should be maintained a steady statewithin .5 to 1 degree
#    until a new temperature change is requested by the person managaing the zone or a scheduled
#    temperature change. All such change decions are managed outside of this module.
#    
#    Safety mechanisms must also be in place to enduse maximum and minimum temperatures will not 
#    be exceeded regardless of temperature change input values. Additionally, diagnostic measurements
#    should be taken periodically and reported to the centralized controller. Saftey limits will
#    be hard coded into the module and not exposed as adjustable settings, this simmulates the out
#    of band control often put into systems via physical measures. The diagnostic function will be
#    utilize random number generation combined with system time information and communication
#    issues detected to simulate the interaction of physical and temporal data collected and 
#    communicated with a remote network node providing maintenance monitoring services.
